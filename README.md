# 🔐 SafeLink Analyzer - Phishing URL Detection using AI & Machine Learning

SafeLink Analyzer is an AI-powered web-based tool designed to detect malicious and phishing URLs with high accuracy. This project combines machine learning models with an interactive Streamlit interface, allowing users to analyze links in real-time while offering features such as PDF report generation, screen sharing, voice and screen recording, and UI customization.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user inputs a URL (e.g., `https://example.com`).
2. Feature extraction is done from the URL (e.g., length, presence of special characters, domain age).
3. The extracted features are passed into a Machine Learning model (e.g., Random Forest, SVM).
4. The model predicts whether the URL is **legitimate** or **malicious**.
5. Users can interact with the prediction results and export them as a **PDF report**.
